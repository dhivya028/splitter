 ðŸ¥­ Fruit Semantic Search with FAISS + Sentence Transformers

This project demonstrates how to perform **semantic similarity search** on a list of fruits using:

- [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/)
- [`faiss`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)
- A sample dataset of fruit names and prices

---

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

- Reads a CSV file containing fruit names and their prices.
- Converts fruit names into dense vector embeddings using the `all-mpnet-base-v2` model.
- Indexes the embeddings using FAISS (`IndexFlatL2`) for fast similarity search.
- Takes a natural language query like `"I would like to eat mango and kiwi"` and returns the top 2 semantically similar fruits.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `fruits_prices.csv`: CSV file with two columns: `Fruit` and `Price ($/kg)`
- `main.py`: Core script that encodes fruit names, builds the FAISS index, and performs the similarity search.
